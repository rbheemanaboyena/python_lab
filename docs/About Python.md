- Features of Python
    
    Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language with several notable features that contribute to its popularity and versatility:
    
    1. Easy to Read Syntax: Python has a simple, intuitive syntax that is easy to read and write, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
    2. Dynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, which means that variables do not have to be declared with a specific data type and can change type dynamically during runtime.
    3. Interpreted: Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed line-by-line at runtime, rather than being compiled to machine code like many other programming languages. This makes it easy to test and debug code.
    4. Object-Oriented Programming: Python is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports object-oriented programming paradigms, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    5. Large Standard Library: Python has a large and comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of functionalities, including file I/O, regular expressions, data structures, and more.
    6. Cross-platform Compatibility: Python is cross-platform compatible and can run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and others, making it a great choice for developing cross-platform applications.
    7. Dynamically-Typed: Python is dynamically typed, which means that the type of a variable can change during runtime.
    8. Extensive Support Libraries: Python has a large collection of third-party libraries and modules, which provide a wide range of functionalities, from scientific computing and data analysis to web development and more.
    9. Open-Source: Python is an open-source language, which means that the source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, or distribute.

- Installation of python
    
    ```bash
    #in ubuntu 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3
    sudo apt-get install python3.8
    python3 --version
    ```
    
- Flavors of python
    1. Python: This is the standard and most widely-used implementation of Python. It is written in C and is the reference implementation of the Python language.
    2. Anaconda: This is a distribution of Python that is specifically geared towards data science and scientific computing. It comes with a large number of pre-installed packages and tools for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
    3. Enthought: This is another distribution of Python that is geared towards scientific computing and data analysis. It includes a comprehensive set of tools and packages for working with data, as well as a custom environment manager.
    4. PyPy: This is an alternative implementation of Python that is designed to be faster and more efficient than CPython. It uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to dynamically translate Python code into machine code, which can result in substantial performance gains in certain cases.
    5. IronPython: This is an implementation of Python that is designed to run on the .NET framework. It is compatible with the same libraries and packages as CPython, but also provides access to the full range of .NET libraries and tools.
    
    Difference between python/ conda
    
    Python is a programming language that is widely used for a variety of purposes, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. It is a high-level language that is easy to learn and use, and provides a wealth of libraries and tools for a wide range of tasks.
    
    Conda, on the other hand, is a package manager and environment manager for Python and other programming languages. It is used to manage dependencies between packages, and to create isolated environments for different projects that each have their own specific set of packages and versions. This makes it easier to manage complex projects with multiple dependencies and ensure that everything works together as expected.

To deploy the API, database, and scheduled data ingestion code in the cloud using AWS, I would use the following tools and services:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk: To deploy the Flask-based REST API. Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that handles the deployment and scaling of the application automatically.

AWS RDS (Relational Database Service): To set up a managed database that can store the weather data records and calculated results. RDS supports a variety of database engines such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. I would choose the database engine based on the specific needs of the application.

AWS Lambda: To execute the scheduled version of the data ingestion code. I would package the code as a Lambda function and set up a CloudWatch Event to trigger the function at a specified interval.

AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service): To store the raw text files containing the weather data. I would upload the files to an S3 bucket, and the data ingestion code running in Lambda would read the files from the bucket and insert the data into the database.

AWS API Gateway: To create a RESTful API that serves as a front-end for the Flask-based API. The API Gateway provides features such as security, rate limiting, and caching.

AWS SSM Params: To store bussiness line parameters.

AWS CloudWatch: For logging we can configure CloudWatch

AWS CloudFormation: To manage the deployment of the infrastructure as code. I would create a CloudFormation template that defines the AWS resources required for the application, such as Elastic Beanstalk environment, RDS instance, S3 bucket, and Lambda function.

AWS CodePipeline: To automate the deployment process. I would set up a pipeline that pulls the code from the version control system, builds the application, deploys it to Elastic Beanstalk, and runs the integration tests.

By using these tools and services, the application can be easily deployed, scaled, and maintained in the cloud, while keeping costs under control. The AWS services provide high availability, scalability, and durability, which are essential for a production-grade application.
